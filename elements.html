										<h2>overview</h2>
										
									</header>
									<p>Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ashok, a passionate data enthusiast with a dynamic background in the ever-evolving world of data. Armed with two years of hands-on experience as a data analyst and an additional year as an SQL developer, I recently added the capstone to my academic journey with a Master's in Data Science.

										My professional journey has been an exhilarating exploration of the intricate web of data, where I've honed my analytical skills and dived deep into the world of SQL development. I thrive on challenges, and my commitment to delivering insightful, data-driven solutions is unwavering.
										
										But hey, life isn't just about bits and bytes! Beyond the data realm, I am an avid sports enthusiast. Whether it's the thrill of a game-winning moment or the strategic dance of players on the field, sports captivate me. I believe in the parallels between the precision required in sports strategies and the meticulous approach needed in data science.
										
										In this digital space, I'm excited to share my experiences, insights, and perhaps a sprinkle of sports analogies. Join me as I navigate the data landscape, explore emerging trends, and tackle the challenges that come my way. Let's make data not just a field of expertise but a journey of continuous discovery.

										<h2>Education</h2>
										
									</header>
									<p>My academic journey has been a fascinating blend of structural blueprints and data algorithms. I laid the foundation of my education with a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University in 2014. Building upon this strong base, I recently earned my Master of Science in Data Science from the University of East London in 2023. This diverse educational background equips me with a unique perspective, allowing me to bridge the realms of engineering precision with the analytical finesse demanded by the world of data science.</p>

										<h2>in data industry</h2>
									
									</header>
									<p>In my role as a Data Analyst, I played a pivotal role in extracting actionable insights from complex datasets. I conducted thorough data analysis, employing statistical techniques to identify trends, patterns, and outliers. My responsibilities included creating visualizations and reports to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I contributed to data-driven decision-making processes and provided valuable input for strategic planning.</p>
									</header>
									<p>As an SQL Developer, I immersed myself in the world of database management and optimization. I designed and implemented robust database solutions, ensuring efficiency and reliability. My role involved writing and optimizing complex SQL queries, stored procedures, and functions to facilitate seamless data retrieval and manipulation. I actively participated in database schema design and maintenance, contributing to the overall enhancement of data integrity and system performance.
